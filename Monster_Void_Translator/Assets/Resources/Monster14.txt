Features: Orange is an orange reptilian Rainbow Friend reminiscent of a gecko. He is characterized by two bulging eyes and two rows of sharp conical teeth lining his elongated jaws. When running, he appears anthropomorphic and makes a pitter-patter sound whilst walking on his hind legs with his arms stretched out.
Story: Orange appears to be the most violent of the Rainbow Friends, getting angry if he isn't fed and running around the place when this happens, attacking anything in his path.

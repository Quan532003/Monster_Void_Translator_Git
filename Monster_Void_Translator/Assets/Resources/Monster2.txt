- Story: Bunbun is a monster with two different forms. Besides the original form, BunBun also has another form called Hellish. Banban's Hellish form has a much more muscular build, his party hats are now gone, revealing demon horns with a spiral pattern similar to those found on party hats. His eyes were completely white and much larger, not to mention triangular, and his mouth had a grin with sharp teeth and a dark tongue. BunBun is created by a special chemical and human genes. That's why Bunbun can communicate and talk to humans

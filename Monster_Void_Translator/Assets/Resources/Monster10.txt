<b>Features:</b> New Wuggy is a tall, slender creature covered in thick, bright blue fur. His arms and legs are several feet in length and end in large yellow hands and feet. The hands have large Velcro straps on them, and the feet possess four digits including thumbs, though they are fused together. His head is large and contains two large black, dilated eyes. New Wuggy eyes resemble googly eyes, and his mouth has rows of sharp teeth concealed by bright red lips. New Wuggy wears a light-blue ribbon on his chest, and his head and torso seem to have visible stitching on them. Closer observation of Wuggy's mouth shows a secondary set of jaws located by his throat, akin to that of a Moray Eel.
<b>Story:</b> New Wuggy's appearance exudes warmth and friendliness but he is a murderous creature, slaughtering anyone he encounters. Wuggy constantly wears a deranged toothy smile, suggestive that he enjoys hunting his victims (or more simply that his anatomy prevents him from not smiling). When Huggy catches the player, he bites into their face, killing them. New Wuggy was created as a security guard for a toy factory in 1984 by unethical and illegal experiments. However, on August 8, 1995, New Wuggy killed many scientists and workers at the factory.

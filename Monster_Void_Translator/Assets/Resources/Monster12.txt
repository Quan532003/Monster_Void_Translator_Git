<b>Features:</b> Mommy Mommy is a large, slender creature bearing an uncanny resemblance to a spider, with only four limbs. She has baby pink skin with curly, tangled noodle-like hot pink hair, styled into a high ponytail using a baby blue hair tie. Her face consists of a pair of wide-set green eyes with tiny pupils and three eyelashes, as well as a gaping, hollow mouth. Dark pink lipstick can be seen adorning her mouth, and she has no nose. A thin neck with a baby blue necklace connects her head to her body, which is comprised of a small angular torso with a dark pink sweetheart neckline, a thin appendage resembling her 'waist', and a rotund dark pink bottom to resemble a sweetheart-bodice dress. Her four limbs are all extremely elastic, capable of stretching 'hundreds of feet' according to the Transfer Request. Her arms end in two crimson glove-like hands with thin baby blue cuffs, while her legs end in ankle-length baby blue stockings with crimson Mary Janes.
<b>Story:</b> Moomy has two form: Normal and Deranged In her deranged form, Mommy's eyes are now completely dilated, giving off an unhinged vibe. Her irises have also faded to a pale artichoke. She will also no longer blink. Her hair is now twisted and mangled, no longer the neat curls in her previous form. Her hands are enlarged maniacally, and her fingers are splayed and elongated to resemble claws. Her body is also twisted.

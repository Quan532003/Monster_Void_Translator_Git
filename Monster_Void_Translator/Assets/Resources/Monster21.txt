<b>Features:</b> Zamazaki & Zamataki are two different monsters in one. Their construction hats they wear may imply them being construction workers. Zamazaki is the turtle, with the seafoam color on his head and legs. Zamataki is the chameleon side, having a darker turquoise tone aside from his seafoam tongue and areas around the eyes. The two are connected by  Zamazaki's teal turtlelike shell. Two legs of each jut from out the bottom, and their heads from the front. Chamataki's coiled tail extends out the back.

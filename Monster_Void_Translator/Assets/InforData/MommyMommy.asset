  featuresAndStory: '<b>Features:</b> Mommy Mommy is a large, slender creature bearing
    an uncanny resemblance to a spider, with only four limbs. She has baby pink skin
    with curly, tangled noodle-like hot pink hair, styled into a high ponytail using
    a baby blue hair tie. Her face consists of a pair of wide-set green eyes with
    tiny pupils and three eyelashes, as well as a gaping, hollow mouth. Dark pink
    lipstick can be seen adorning her mouth, and she has no nose. A thin neck with
    a baby blue necklace connects her head to her body, which is comprised of a small
    angular torso with a dark pink sweetheart neckline, a thin appendage resembling
    her ''waist'', and a rotund dark pink bottom to resemble a sweetheart-bodice
    dress. Her four limbs are all extremely elastic, capable of stretching ''hundreds
    of feet'' according to the Transfer Request. Her arms end in two crimson glove-like
    hands with thin baby blue cuffs, while her legs end in ankle-length baby blue
    stockings with crimson Mary Janes.


    <b>Story:</b> Moomy has two form: Normal
    and Deranged In her deranged form, Mommy''s eyes are now completely dilated,
    giving off an unhinged vibe. Her irises have also faded to a pale artichoke.
    She will also no longer blink. Her hair is now twisted and mangled, no longer
    the neat curls in her previous form. Her hands are enlarged maniacally, and her
    fingers are splayed and elongated to resemble claws. Her body is also twisted.'

  monsterName: Mommy Mommy
  gender: Female
  birthDay: 1991
  Origin: Poppy playtime
  features: Mommy Mommy is a large, slender creature bearing an uncanny resemblance
    to a spider, with only four limbs. She has baby pink skin with curly, tangled
    noodle-like hot pink hair, styled into a high ponytail using a baby blue hair
    tie. Her face consists of a pair of wide-set green eyes with tiny pupils and
    three eyelashes, as well as a gaping, hollow mouth. She has no nose. A thin neck
    with a baby blue necklace connects her head to her body, which is comprised of
    a small angular torso with a dark pink sweetheart neckline, a thin appendage
    resembling her 'waist', and a rotund dark pink bottom. Her four limbs are all
    extremely elastic, capable of stretching 'hundreds of feet'. Her arms end in
    two crimson glove-like hands with thin baby blue cuffs, while her legs end in
    ankle-length baby blue stockings.
  story: 'Moomy has two form: Normal and Deranged

    In her deranged form, Mommy''s
    eyes are now completely dilated, giving off an unhinged vibe. Her irises have
    also faded to a pale artichoke. She will also no longer blink. Her hair is now
    twisted and mangled, no longer the neat curls in her previous form. Her hands
    are enlarged maniacally, and her fingers are splayed and elongated to resemble
    claws. Her body is also twisted.'

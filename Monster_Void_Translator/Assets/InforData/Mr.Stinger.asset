  featuresAndStory: '<b>Features:</b> Mr.Stinger''s design depicts an orange jellyfish
    with one eye in the middle of his bell connecting to 6 extendable tentacles.
    Four of his tentacles are down, while the other two are up at the sides of his
    head in a friendly pose.


    <b>Story:</b> Mr.Stinger is an intelligent monster.
    Mr.Stingercould be considered to be the least hostile monster. Compared to most
    other mascots who attack on sight, he usually attempts to be diplomatic and/or
    use his telepathic powers and usually only uses fighting as a last resort.'

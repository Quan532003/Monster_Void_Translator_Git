  featuresAndStory: "<b>Features:</b> Bunbun is a tall, red humanoid with an elliptical
    head with two hats on two horns, only two round eyes and a toothless mouth with
    a long, soft tongue inside.        Bunbun's catchphrase: \"\"\"\"Sharing is caring!
    What's yours is mine!\"\"\"\" \n\n<b>Story:</b> Bunbun is a monster with two
    different forms. Besides the original form, BunBun also has another form called
    Hellish. Banban's Hellish form has a much more muscular build, his party hats
    are now gone, revealing demon horns with a spiral pattern similar to those found
    on party hats. His eyes were completely white and much larger, not to mention
    triangular, and his mouth had a grin with sharp teeth and a dark tongue. BunBun
    is created by a special chemical and human genes. That's why Bunbun can communicate
    and talk to humans."

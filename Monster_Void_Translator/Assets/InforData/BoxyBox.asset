  features: Boxy Box is a vibrant, colorful jack-in-the-box toy. The main body is
    a light blue square box with golden shapes adorning each side. There is also
    a wind-up crank. Aside from the stars, each shape can open up to the box's interior,
    revealing each of his crimson red body parts. His feet and head are cubical and
    he has matted red fur. Boxy Box's eyes are big and dilated. He has claws on his
    feet and hands and has curved sharpened teeth. His limbs consist of dark-red
    metallic springs, allowing them to stretch far out.
  story: "Boxy Box is a fun and energetic monster, but a bit clumsy. But as a monster,
    he is monstrously savage, being able to eat people in one fell swoop. \r\nThis
    Monster is a streamlined hunter with both speed and agility on his side. His
    springy limbs allow him to jump high and far to reach wherever he desires.\r\nBoxy
    has several ways to surprise his prey. He can go into box form and hide amongst
    the scenery. His spring-arm allows him to grab survivors and pull them close
    before clawing them to death. On top of it all, his music will become louder
    and faster the closer he gets to his prey."

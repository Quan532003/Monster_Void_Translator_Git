  featuresAndStory: '<b>Features:</b> Boxy Box is a vibrant, colorful jack-in-the-box
    toy. The main body is a light blue square box with golden shapes adorning each
    side. There is also a wind-up crank. Aside from the stars, each shape can open
    up to the box''s interior, revealing each of his crimson red body parts. His
    feet and head are cubical and he has matted red fur. Boxy Box''s eyes are big
    and dilated. He has claws on his feet and hands and has curved sharpened teeth.
    His limbs consist of dark-red metallic springs, allowing them to stretch far
    out.


    <b>Story:</b> Boxy Box is a fun and energetic monster, but a bit clumsy.
    But as a monster, he is monstrously savage, being able to eat people in one fell
    swoop. This Monster is a streamlined hunter with both speed and agility on his
    side. His springy limbs allow him to jump high and far to reach wherever he desires.
    Boxy has several ways to surprise his prey. He can go into box form and hide
    amongst the scenery. His spring-arm allows him to grab survivors and pull them
    close before clawing them to death. On top of it all, his music will become louder
    and faster the closer he gets to his prey.'

  Origin: Poppy playtime
  features: New Wuggy is a tall, slender creature covered in thick, bright blue fur.
    His arms and legs are several feet in length and end in large yellow hands and
    feet. The hands have large Velcro straps on them, and the feet possess four digits.
    His head is large and contains two large black, dilated eyes. New Wuggy eyes
    resemble googly eyes, and his mouth has rows of sharp teeth concealed by bright
    red lips. New Wuggy wears a light-blue ribbon on his chest, and his head and
    torso.
  story: 'New Wuggy''s appearance exudes warmth and friendliness but he is a murderous
    creature, slaughtering anyone he encounters. Wuggy constantly wears a deranged
    toothy smile, suggestive that he enjoys hunting his victims. When New Wuggy catches
    the player, he bites into their face, killing them.

    New Wuggy was created
    as a security guard for a toy factory in 1984 by unethical and illegal experiments.
    However, on August 8, 1995, New Wuggy killed many scientists and workers at the
    factory.'

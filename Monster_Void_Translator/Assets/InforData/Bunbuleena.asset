    wear his party hat, instead she wears a monotonous pink bow. She also doesn''t
    have a tongue like Banban.


    <b>Story:</b> Bunbuleena is an experiment that
    takes genes from Bunbun, so Bunbuleena also has the same characteristics as Bunbun.
    Bunbuleena also has 2 forms. Her monster form is a tall white demon with a wide
    open mouth. She has fiery red eyes with pink makeup pouring down her melted face.'

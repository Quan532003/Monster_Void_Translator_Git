  story: Skubidu has a ghostly voice and song. That song is both a tool for communication
    within their species and has the ability to brainwash humans. Skubidu attacks
    humans by eating their heads. Skubidu spawns new Skubidus from their mouths after
    eating. The more heads he can eat, the bigger Skubidu will be. Skubidu's status
    and rank depended on their size. And the special thing is that they can fly.

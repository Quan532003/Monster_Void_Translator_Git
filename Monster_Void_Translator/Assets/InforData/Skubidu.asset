    Skubidu is a character in an animated series released on Youtube. Skubidu. is
    a monster with a head growing out of a white toilet that has a ghostly voice
    and song. That song is both a tool for communication within their species and
    has the ability to brainwash humans. Skubidu attacks humans by eating their heads.
    Skibidi spawns new Skubidus from their mouths after eating. The more heads he
    can eat, the bigger Skubidu will be. Skubidu''s status and rank depended on their
    size. And the special thing is that they can fly.'

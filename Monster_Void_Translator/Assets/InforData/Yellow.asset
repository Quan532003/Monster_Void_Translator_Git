  features: Yellow is a bird inspired monster who has a brown nest with a Helicopter-propeller,
    and two eyes with two long arms that seem to look like wings. He has sharp teeth,
    and has a pointed tail in his back. When he walks, he will keep his arms close
    together and stand tall, but when chasing after a player, Yellow will flap his
    wings with the mouth open and lean forward.

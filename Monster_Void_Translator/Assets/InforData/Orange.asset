  featuresAndStory: '<b>Features:</b> Orange is an orange reptilian Rainbow Friend
    reminiscent of a gecko. He is characterized by two bulging eyes and two rows
    of sharp conical teeth lining his elongated jaws. When running, he appears anthropomorphic
    and makes a pitter-patter sound whilst walking on his hind legs with his arms
    stretched out.


    <b>Story:</b> Orange appears to be the most violent of the
    Rainbow Friends, getting angry if he isn''t fed and running around the place
    when this happens, attacking anything in his path.'

  Origin: Rainbow Friend
  features: Orange is an orange reptilian Rainbow Friend reminiscent of a gecko.
    He is characterized by two bulging eyes and two rows of sharp conical teeth lining
    his elongated jaws. When running, he appears anthropomorphic and makes a pitter-patter
    sound whilst walking on his hind legs with his arms stretched out.
  story: Orange appears to be the most violent of the Rainbow Friends, getting angry
    if he isn't fed and running around the place when this happens, attacking anything
    in his path.

  featuresAndStory: '<b>Features:</b> Zamazaki & Zamataki are two different monsters
    in one. Their construction hats they wear may imply them being construction workers.
    Zamazaki is the turtle, with the seafoam color on his head and legs. Zamataki
    is the chameleon side, having a darker turquoise tone aside from his seafoam
    tongue and areas around the eyes. The two are connected by  Zamazaki''s teal
    turtlelike shell. Two legs of each jut from out the bottom, and their heads from
    the front. Chamataki''s coiled tail extends out the back.
